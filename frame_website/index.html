			<h1>Qiaodong Tea Shop</h1>
			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>In 2000, Xia established her boutique tea business in Nanning, providing quality tea products to 
				local markets. Three years later, she met her husband Li, who joined her in managing the business. 
				Together, they changed the business name to "Qiaodong Tea Shop" after Li's family restaurant chain 
				that had achieved great success in the local area. They chose the name "Qiaodong Tea Shop" to leverage 
				the success of Li's family restaurant chain and maintain their reputation and customer goodwill.</p>

			<p>In their roles at the shop, Xia was in charge of quality control and procurement, while Li managed relationships and sales, overseeing the everyday business. Over the past 23 years, the couple has faced challenges, including the COVID pandemic, which led to several extended closures of the market where the shop is located. 
				Despite facing such challenges, Xia and Li were determined to continue serving their customers with high-quality tea products.
